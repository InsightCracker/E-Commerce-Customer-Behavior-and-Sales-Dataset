# 🛒 E-Commerce Customer Behavior and Sales Dataset

## 📊 Executive Summary
This report presents an overview of e-commerce customer behavior and sales performance for the 2023–2024 period, analyzed using SQL and Power BI. Total sales amounted to ₺4.92 million from 5,000 customers, with an average order value of ₺983.11. Electronics, Home & Garden, and Sports were the top-performing categories, while Books and Food recorded the lowest sales. Istanbul led all cities with ₺1.33 million in revenue, followed by Ankara and Izmir.

Customer demographics showed a balanced gender distribution and a predominance of young adults aged 21–28. Credit cards were the most preferred payment method, and mobile devices accounted for the majority of transactions. The average customer rating was 3.9/5, with an average delivery time of 6.5 days. Overall, the findings highlight strong customer retention, growing mobile engagement, and opportunities to enhance logistics and promotional strategies for improved performance.

## 📝 Business Problem
The e-commerce company faced challenges in understanding customer purchasing behavior, sales performance, and revenue distribution across product categories and locations. The absence of a centralized analytical system limited management’s ability to track key performance indicators (KPIs), identify high-performing segments, and evaluate the effectiveness of discounts and marketing strategies.

Additionally, decision-making was hindered by fragmented data sources and a lack of real-time visibility into customer trends, payment preferences, and delivery performance. To address these issues, a data-driven analytical dashboard was developed using Power BI to integrate sales, demographic, and operational data enabling actionable insights for improving sales strategies, customer retention, and overall business performance.

## 🔍 Key Insight
* Electronics accounted for over 47% of total sales, making it the highest-performing product category.

* Promotional sales (purchases made with discounts) contributed 30.4% of total revenue, indicating strong responsiveness to price incentives.

* Istanbul generated 27% of overall sales, while Eskisehir contributed only 3%, highlighting regional disparities in demand.

* Only 36.6% of customers provided a 5-star rating, suggesting opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction and service quality.

* Mobile devices were used by 55.9% of customers to place orders, emphasizing the growing dominance of mobile commerce.

* Credit cards remained the most preferred payment method, used by over 40% of customers.


## 🎯 Methodology
Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed in Microsoft Excel, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and completeness. The refined dataset was then imported into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for the query writing and then to Power BI Desktop for further analysis and visualization. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average order value, customer segmentation, and category performance were developed to evaluate business outcomes.

Interactive dashboards were designed in Power BI to present insights on sales trends, customer behavior, geographical distribution, payment preferences, and discount effectiveness. Visual tools such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps were used to enhance interpretability and support data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠️ Skills
* Data Analysis & Visualization: Proficient in analyzing large datasets, identifying trends, and presenting insights using Power BI and Excel.

* Business Intelligence: Skilled in developing interactive dashboards, KPI tracking, and performance reporting to support data-driven decisions.

* Data Management: Experienced in data cleaning, transformation, and validation using Excel, SQL, and Power Query.

* Database Querying: Competent in writing and optimizing SQL queries for data extraction and manipulation.

* Reporting & Presentation: Strong ability to interpret analytical results and communicate findings clearly to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 💡 Recommendation
* Focus on the Electronics category: Since Electronics contributes nearly half of total sales, the company should strengthen supplier relationships, maintain stock availability, and introduce targeted promotions to sustain and expand this segment.

* Optimize promotional strategies: With 30.4% of sales generated during discount periods, management should evaluate which promotions yield the highest ROI and strategically schedule them during low-demand months to boost overall sales volume.

* Enhance regional marketing efforts: Given Istanbul’s dominance (27%) and Eskisehir’s low performance (3%), localized marketing campaigns and logistics improvements should be implemented to increase brand visibility and accessibility in underperforming regions.

* Improve customer satisfaction: As only 36.6% of customers provided a 5-star rating, post-purchase surveys, faster delivery, and improved customer support can help enhance the overall user experience and brand loyalty.

* Strengthen mobile user experience: With 55.9% of transactions coming from mobile devices, investing in mobile app optimization, faster checkout, and personalized offers can further drive conversions.

* Diversify payment options: While credit cards dominate (40%), promoting alternative methods such as digital wallets and debit cards can attract a broader customer base and reduce payment friction.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can reveal actionable insights into customer behavior and sales performance. It serves as a template for businesses seeking to understand their customers better and make data-driven strategic decisions.
